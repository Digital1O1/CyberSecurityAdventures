# Make sure you...
- Set up a the `Oracle Network Manager`
    - File --> Tools --> Network Manager --> Create 
    - Then right click on target VM
        - Network --> Ensure `Attached to` is set to `Host-only Adapter`
        - Set `name` to the newly created network 
            - In this case it's : `vboxnet0`

# Things that are known
- Running Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
- Target IP address : `192.168.56.1/24`
---

# Things I've Attempted
- Scanned the ports 
```bash  
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-09 19:28 CDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.100
Host is up (0.000059s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:B7:5B:DA (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101
Host is up (0.00025s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:8B:97:CA (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 3.94 seconds
```
- To verify/ID each IP that showed up in the scan
    - Verify your own IP address : `ip a` 
        - Look for interfaces associated with vboxnet0 or something similar
        ```bash
            4: vboxnet0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 0a:00:27:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 192.168.56.1/24 brd 192.168.56.255 scope global vboxnet0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 fe80::800:27ff:fe00:0/64 scope link 
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```
- Checked ARP cache 
    - What is the ARP cache?
        - Look up table 
        - Stores mappings between `IP addresses` and `MAC addresses` 
    - What was done with the ARP cache?
        - Used `cat` to pull up table
        ```bash
        cat /proc/net/arp
        IP address       HW type     Flags       HW address            Mask     Device
        192.168.56.100   0x1         0x2         08:00:27:b7:5b:da     *        vboxnet0
        192.168.56.101   0x1         0x2         08:00:27:8b:97:ca     *        vboxnet0
        192.168.1.206    0x1         0x2         94:8f:cf:04:8c:72     *        wlp0s20f3
        192.168.1.147    0x1         0x2         5e:e0:48:23:54:94     *        wlp0s20f3
        192.168.1.254    0x1         0x2         94:8f:cf:04:8c:70     *        wlp0s20f3
        ```
        - Confirmed the first two IP addresses are associated with the virtual box 

- Ran TCP scan and got this
```bash

- There is a SSH vulnerability 
    - Reference link 
        - https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/207279
        - https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6560-3
    - Nevermind... The vulnerability (USN-6560-2) just states OpenSSH incorrectly handled username/hostnames with `shell metacharacters` 
    - Can't really use this exploit since you don't know the usernames?
    - So an attacker could use this to perform OS command injections

- Tried `gobuster` 
    - Use the following command : `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.56.101 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
    - Also installed `dirb` 
        - Command : `sudo apt install dirb` 
        - Then cloned the following repository : `git clone git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git`
            - Just to get `common.txt` file 
            - That's found at `SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`
            - Then used `cp` to move common.txt to `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
    - Ran the `gobuster` command and got this
    ```bash
    Gobuster v3.5
